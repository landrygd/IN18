## Get started

The core of the application is in the src/app directory by convention of the Ionic projects.

I invite you to learn about the Angular and Ionic frameworks and to have a good level of Javascript to understand the project.

### Prerequisite

- Angular v9+

It is necessary to have previously installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
Then install the prerequisite npm dependencies with the following commands:
```bash
npm install
cd electron
npm install
```

## Start

From the project root, enter the following commands:
```bash
ionic serve
```
A browser window should then open automatically on the page: http://localhost:8100/

### Windows
From the project root, enter the following commands to compile:
```bash
ionic capacitor run electron

To export:
```bash
npm start electron:win
